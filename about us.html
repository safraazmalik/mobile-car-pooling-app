            This apk is used to transport passengers that are looking for cheap and quick means of transport to move from place to place.
            For example: If there are people that want to go to school but they are all in different locations.The students request a ride and the vehicle that is going to that location will pick them up and take them there.

            Someone can also request a car and can choose whether they want it driven or they wish to drive it themselves,
            but they must have an official driving license(that is valid).
